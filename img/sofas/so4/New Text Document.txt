Mahogany "Jackson" Phyfe Sofa
$5,800

A beautiful Phyfe-type example of Empire Classical, this full-sized Mahogany sofa is plushly upholstered, 
and also features four detailed Brass lion's claw feet, 
typical of the Empire Classical look. Classic book-matched veneering on the back rail gives the illusion of three dimensional depth.
 The interior seating is completed with 100% new
