Morello Guitar Pick Side Table In Walnut
$595


This Mid Century end table is crafted from solid Walnut,
 and is finished with a hand rubbed oil/hardwax blend. The top is an elongated triangle meant to mimic the shape of a guitar pick.
 Both the legs and the top are hand shaped to achieve curves that set them apart from machine produced work.
 It is a perfect accent piece for both the Noll and Spicoli coffee tables.
